\item \textit{Notes:} Each cell reports the number of individuals who were assigned to the condition (Excuse or No Excuse) in the corresponding row and who were classified by the Support Vector Machine as belonging to the condition in the corresponding column. The classifier was trained on a 75\% sample of the data; the table reports prediction results on the test set of the remaining 25\% of the data. Overall accuracy is calculated as the proportion of correct predictions.
