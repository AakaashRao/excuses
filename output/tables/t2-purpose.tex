\item \textit{Notes:} The dependent variable in each column is an indicator taking value 1 if  the respondent's perceived purpose of the study was coded to fall into the corresponding category. ``Excuse'' takes value 1 if the respondent correctly inferred the study was about whether knowing that others will know one had an ``excuse'' for donating would affect the donation decision. ``Immigration attitudes'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated the study was about attitudes toward immigration. ``Public image'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated the study was about whether knowing one's decision will be observable to others would affect the donation decision. ``Information'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated the study was about disseminating information about immigration. ``Persuasion'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated the researchers were attempting to persuade them either to donate or not to donate. ``Bias'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated the researchers were biased. ``Other'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated a purpose that did not fall into any of the above categories. Categories other than ``Other'' are not mutually exclusive. All specifications pool the main experiment and the pilot and contol for demographics and partisan affiliation. Demographic controls include age, age squared, a set of race indicators, a Hispanic indicator, a male indicator, and a set of education indicators. Partisan affiliation controls include dummies for strong Republican, weak Republican, Republican-leaning Independent, and Democrat-leaning Independent. Robust standard errors are reported.
