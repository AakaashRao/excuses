	"t2-main": "Columns 1-3 report results estimated on the sample from the main experiment, while Columns 4-6 pool the sample from the main experiment with the sample from the pilot. Demographic controls include age, age squared, a set of race indicators, a Hispanic indicator, a male indicator, and a set of education indicators. Partisan affiliation controls include dummies for strong Republican, weak Republican, Republican-leaning Independent, and Democrat-leaning Independent. Robust standard errors are reported.",
	"t2-partyheterogeneity": "Columns 1-2 limit the sample to Republicans, while Columns 3-4 limit the sample to Independents. Columns 1 and 3 report results estimated on the sample from the main experiment, while Columns 2 and 4 pool the sample from the main experiment with the sample from the pilot. Demographic controls include age, age squared, a set of race indicators, a Hispanic indicator, a male indicator, and a set of education indicators. Partisan affiliation controls include dummies for strong Republican, weak Republican, Republican-leaning Independent, and Democrat-leaning Independent. Robust standard errors are reported.",
	"t2-cityheterogeneity": "Republican vote share is scaled to a standard normal distribution. Columns 1-2 include both Independents and Republicans, Columns 3-4 limit the sample to Republicans, and Columns 5-6 limit the sample to Independents. Columns 1, 3, and 5 report results estimated on the sample from the main experiment, while Columns 2, 4, and 6 pool the sample from the main experiment with the sample from the pilot. Demographic controls include age, age squared, a set of race indicators, a Hispanic indicator, a male indicator, and a set of education indicators. Partisan affiliation controls include dummies for strong Republican, weak Republican, Republican-leaning Independent, and Democrat-leaning Independent. Robust standard errors are reported.",
	"t2-purpose": "The dependent variable in each column is an indicator for whether the respondent's perceived purpose of the study was coded to fall into the corresponding category. ``Excuse'' takes value 1 if the respondent correctly inferred the study was about whether knowing that others will know one had an ``excuse'' for donating would affect the donation decision. ``Immigration attitudes'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated the study was about attitudes toward immigration. ``Public image'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated the study was about whether knowing one's decision will be observable to others would affect the donation decision. ``Information'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated the study was about disseminating information about immigration. ``Persuasion'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated the researchers were attempting to persuade them either to donate or not to donate. ``Bias'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated the researchers were biased. ``Other'' takes value 1 if the respondent stated a purpose that did not fall into any of the above categories. Categories other than ``Other'' are not mutually exclusive. All specifications pool the main experiment and the pilot and contol for demographics and partisan affiliation. Demographic controls include age, age squared, a set of race indicators, a Hispanic indicator, a male indicator, and a set of education indicators. Partisan affiliation controls include dummies for strong Republican, weak Republican, Republican-leaning Independent, and Democrat-leaning Independent. Robust standard errors are reported.",
	"t2-conditionprediction": "Each cell reports the number of individuals who were assigned to the condition in the corresponding row and who were classified by the Support Vector Machine as belonging to the condition in the corresponding column. Each panel limits the data to the corresponding two conditions. The classifiers were trained on a 75\\% sample of the limited dataset; the table reports prediction results on the test set of the remaining 25\\% of the limited dataset. Overall accuracy is calculated as the proportion of correct predictions.",
	"t2-attrition": "The dependent variable is an indicator that takes value 1 if the respondent attrited post-randomization. The sample is limited to respondents in the Excuse and No Excuse condition. Robust standard errors are reported.",	
	"t1-score": "The dependent variable in Panel A is the negative of the $z$-score of the respondent's guess as to his or her matched respondent's score on the Foreign Culture Tolerance Scale, where we take the negative to interpret higher values as greater bias. The dependent variable in Panel B is the $z$-score of the respondent's guess as to his or her matched respondent's score on the Gullibility Scale. Both scales were originally scored between 0 and 100. Columns 1-3 report results estimated on the sample from the main experiment, while Columns 4-6 pool the sample from the main experiment with the sample from the pilot. Demographic controls include age, age squared, a set of race indicators, a Hispanic indicator, a male indicator, and a set of education indicators. The partisan affiliation control is an indicator that takes value 1 if the respondent self-reports being a strong Democrat, with weak Democrat as the reference category. Robust standard errors are reported.",
	"t1-validation": "The dependent variable in Panel A is the negative of the $z$-score of the respondent's guess as to his or her matched respondent's score on the Foreign Culture Tolerance Scale, where we take the negative to interpret higher values as greater bias.

	"t1-word": "The dependent variable in Panel A is the probability that the respondent uses a word relating to bias when describing why he or she thinks the matched respondent donated to Fund the Wall, while the dependent variable in Panel B is the probability that the respondent uses a word relating to gullibility in response to the same question. Columns 1-3 report results estimated on the sample from the main experiment, while Columns 4-6 pool the sample from the main experiment with the sample from the pilot. Demographic controls include age, age squared, a set of race indicators, a Hispanic indicator, a male indicator, and a set of education indicators. Partisan affiliation controls include a dummy for strong Democrats, with weak Democrats as the reference category. Robust standard errors are reported.",
