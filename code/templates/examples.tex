Disagreement with the statement that ``Black Lives Matter'' &
  ``All Lives Matter,'' not just black lives &
  Most people likely understand that ``Black Lives Matter'' does not imply that only black lives matter; indeed, many who oppose ``Black Lives Matter'' on this ground would likely support the claim ``Blue Lives Matter''\tablefootnote{https://www.worldcat.org/title/making-of-black-lives-matter-a-brief-history-of-an-idea/oclc/1059579720, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-black-lives-matter_b_8191424}  \\

Public support for Confederate symbols (flag, monuments, statues) &
  The Confederacy represented a defense of states' rights and Southern heritage, not slavery &
  Claim widely rejected by historians: indeed, slavery in Southern states was enshrined in law and under no particular threat when the Civil War broke out\tablefootnote{https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Lost-Cause-South-Fought/dp/1621574547, https://qz.com/378533/for-the-last-time-the-american-civil-war-was-not-about-states-rights/} \\

Enhanced voter ID laws that disproportionately affect minorities &
  Voter fraud is rampant &
  Voter fraud is extremely rare and has been for decades\tablefootnote{https://stanforddpl.org/papers/wu_et_al_2020_dead_voting/wu_et_al_2020_dead_voting.pdf, https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/mar/17/greg-abbott/light-match-greg-abbotts-claim-about-rampant-voter/, https://apnews.com/article/dafac088c90242ef8b282fbebddf5b56} \\

Opposition to measures to promote greater gender diversity in STEM fields &
  Women are genetically less suited to STEM fields than men &
  A vast body of scientific evidence finds no support for the claim that men are more suited for STEM fields than women\tablefootnote{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12680306/,  https://www.vox.com/2017/8/11/16127992/google-engineer-memo-research-science-women-biology-tech-james-damore} \\

Immigration should be dramatically reduced &
  Immigrants take American jobs and represent a drain on the welfare system &
  Mixed evidence on the effects of immigration on employment and wages; immigrants pay billions into the social security system, with many being eligible for claiming social security benefits\tablefootnote{https://www.cato.org/cato-journal/fall-2017/does-immigration-reduce-wages, https://wol.iza.org/articles/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers/long, https://www.marketplace.org/2019/01/28/undocumented-immigrants-quietly-pay-billions-social-security-and-receive-no/} \\

Muslims should be banned from entering the country &
  Muslims are disproportionately likely to be terrorists &
  Since 9/11, fewer Americans have been killed by jihadist terrorists than by domestic/far-right terrorists or by school shooters\tablefootnote{https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/us/domestic-terrorism-laws.html, https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/terrorism-in-america/what-threat-united-states-today/, https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/07/us/ten-years-of-school-shootings-trnd/} \\ \bottomrule
